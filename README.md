# Fio Next.js Starter Template

Fio is an opinionated Next.js 16 starter with a landing page, component
playground, client and server data-fetching examples, theming, feedback UI,
error handling, and SEO defaults already wired together.

## Highlights

- Next.js App Router with React Server Components and strict TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui with reusable project-level primitives
- Light, dark, and system themes through `next-themes`
- TanStack Query for client-side server state and `ofetch` API helpers
- Zustand persistence for the live primary-colour customizer
- Sonner toasts, app modals, tooltips, and a route progress indicator
- Dynamic Open Graph images rendered by Takumi
- Metadata, canonical URLs, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml` defaults
- Route and global error boundaries with reusable fallback UI
- Route-local `_modules` architecture to keep feature code co-located

## Quick start

The project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and tracks `bun.lockb` as its lockfile.

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env.local
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The two data demos call public third-party APIs, so they require network access
and should be replaced or removed when adapting the starter to a real product.

Code used by only one route belongs under that route's `_modules` directory.
Promote it to `src/components`, `src/hooks`, or `src/lib` only when it is shared.

| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Framework      | Next.js 16.2, React 19.2, TypeScript 5.9             |

Path aliases are configured as `@/*` for `src/*` and `~/*` for `public/*`.

## Production

Run the same checks used before deployment:

```bash
bun run lint
bun run typecheck
SITE_URL=https://example.com bun run build
```

The generated app can be served with `bun run start`. Deployment-provider
configuration for Cloudflare Workers is included through OpenNext.

### Cloudflare Workers

Authenticate Wrangler once, then preview the application in the same `workerd`
runtime used by Cloudflare:

```bash
bunx wrangler login
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
SITE_URL=http://localhost:8787 bun run preview
```

Set `SITE_URL` to the final `workers.dev` or custom-domain origin when deploying:

```bash
SITE_URL=https://example.com bun run deploy
```

For Cloudflare Workers Builds, use `bun run build:cloudflare` as the build
command and `bunx opennextjs-cloudflare deploy` as the deploy command. Add
`SITE_URL` to both **Build variables and secrets** and the Worker's runtime
environment variables. The build output under `.open-next/` is generated and
intentionally ignored by Git.

The starter uses OpenNext's read-only static-assets cache for prerendered pages,
so it does not require R2, D1, or Durable Objects for the included demos. A new
deployment refreshes the cached output. Add OpenNext's R2 incremental cache and
Durable Object queue before depending on runtime revalidation in a production
product.

## Current scope

This repository is a starter and demo surface. It does not include a real
backend, authentication, database, form stack, analytics, or provider-specific
application infrastructure. The public API integrations and sample content are
examples, not product dependencies.

The repository intentionally includes both `.agents/` and `.claude/` tooling so
the same project conventions are available to different coding agents. Start
with [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), and
[.claude/AGENTS.md](.claude/AGENTS.md) before making structural changes.
